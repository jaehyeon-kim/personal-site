description: "As described in the product page, AWS Glue is a serverless data integration service that makes it easy to discover, prepare, and combine data for analytics, machine learning, and application development. For development, a development endpoint is recommended but it can be costly, inconvenient or unavailable (for Glue 2.0). The AWS Glue team published a Docker image that includes the AWS Glue binaries and all the dependencies packaged together. After inspecting it, I find some modifications are necessary in order to build a development environment on it. In this post, I’ll demonstrate how to build development environments for AWS Glue 1.0 and 2.0 using the Docker image and the Visual Studio Code Remote – Containers extension."
