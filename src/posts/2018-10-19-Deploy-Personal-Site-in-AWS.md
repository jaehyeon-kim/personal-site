For blogging, it is set up so that posts in Markdown are parsed by markdown-with-front-matter-loader and pre-generated by prerender-spa-plugin in production build. In relation to deployment, AWS has a comprehensive set of services. Specifically S3 for static website hosting, Cloudfront for content delivery network and Route53 for Domain Name System (DNS). In this post, it'll be illustrated how the website is deployed with those services."

In the [previous post](/blog/2018-10-10-Create-Personal-Site-with-Vue), it is discussed how to build my personal website with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). For blogging, it is set up so that posts in *Markdown* are parsed by `markdown-with-front-matter-loader` and pre-generated by `prerender-spa-plugin` in production build. In relation to deployment, AWS has a comprehensive set of services. Specifically [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) for *static website hosting*, [Cloudfront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) for *content delivery network* and [Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) for *Domain Name System (DNS)*. In this post, it'll be illustrated how the website is deployed with those services.

## Deploy to S3

At first, it is necessary to create a S3 bucket. Note that S3 bucket name is globally unique so that it may be a good idea to think about the name before creating it. The bucket is created in *Asia Pacific (Sydney)* region which is close to where I live.
