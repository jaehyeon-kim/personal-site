description: "Authorization is the mechanism that controls who can do what on which resource in an application. Although it is a critical part of an application, there are limited resources available on how to build authorization into an app effectively. In this post, Iâ€™ll be illustrating how to set up authorization in a GraphQL API using a custom directive and Oso, an open-source authorization library. This tutorial covers the NodeJS variant of Oso, but it also supports Python and other languages."
